My personality is very easy to change. It is also temporarily tested that ISTP may be temporary, but because of the natural growth of natural growth, it will gradually decrease. Maybe this time it is set?<br>I like to write programs (Python’s first! What is Jvav?), I like to understand and transform the world with a programmatic thinking, because this can leave me out of the consequences of emotional treatment and avoid being assimilated by others. I do self -media, what are the procedures, such as video understanding, graph -based recommendation algorithms, and so on. I only take notes for my own project, and I am willing to put all the bookmarks into the notes for easy search.<br>Regarding the school’s knowledge, I was forced to learn in elementary school. On the way to the Olympic class, I saw a car driving, so I flew over, thinking that my dad would definitely keep up, maybe he could kill him. As a result, he didn’t die, and he rotted my ears. In fact, my dad did not understand the Olympic problem at all, and even a few squares that had dug a piece of squares could not be countless. What he would know was nothing more than metaphysics and relationship, but he could never figure out the concept of abstraction.<br>The same is true of playing the piano. I like the piano, but I don’t like someone to teach me to play the piano. I run to class every day, which really collapses me. Once the piano teacher touched the glass door, the door was broken, and her hand was hurt. I was a bit sympathetic at the time, but I thought more about me (temporary). I don’t need to take this piano class today. The piano teacher has nothing to do with me, and I won’t accompany me when I need it, comfort me, and will only tell me the messy fingers when I don’t need her. When I took the test, a bunch of people looked around me, and in the classroom of my piano. The glass of the glass was crowded to die. I didn’t carry much content at the time, and I didn’t want to carry it at all. I didn’t want to play. After a while, I was gone. I said that I forgot and left. They really issued a certificate. In fact, I feel like music, but the memory is not good, and I only remember the notes with emotion. The machine synthetic music I do now can make up for this problem. My dad is really stupid. When he hear the electronic sound, he said it was not good. In fact, the vibrato he brushed every day was electronic music.<br>My dad kept putting me in the room, even if it was winter and summer vacation. I was mad, until I had a computer at home. I played games with a computer, but I was played. I am not happy, stealing my parents’ money, and was beaten. Take me to the amusement park, I don’t like thrilling projects. My dad has to let me go and pull my brother. I see my brother so happy. I think he may really don’t understand my mind. No one understands my mind. Everyone here does not let me leave this ghost place, damn it. I kicked a fierce place to his fragile place (my dad taught), but he just passed the pain, and he still smiled. I think I am really weak. It ’s okay for others to cut two knives, but I need to avoid being angry by hurting others.<br>I was bullied by my classmates when I went to elementary school. I turned to bully others and started throwing their triangle board downstairs. Pencils, I hope that this can relieve the anger in my heart. Once I was squeezed up by the front table every day, I took his pen to his schoolbag while he did exercises. After he came back, he looked at his bag with surprised eyes, and since then he has been in peace.<br>My dad in junior high school sent me to the most rolling king school in the city. The king of the rolls is naturally very knowledgeable, and they know more than me, but one or two wonds is like a bottle, and a small number of websites and knowledge will be shared, but basically all the contents of the exam are promoted. After I went in, the pressure was extremely huge, but I liked to observe others very much. Others had to see the famous hall from shit. A classmate just enrolled in school immediately wrote a class of Quanquan, and I remembered it at the time, thinking why it was not me. There are almost all smart phones in the class, and I don’t.<br>My mother has a smartphone. When I arrived at my mother’s house, there was only a TV. I was boring to die. When I grabbed it, my mother’s mouth was bleeding. My dad did not know what the situation (maybe someone reported it). The situation of the situation ran out and hit me, and punished me for an hour, and gave them a hoe to admit my mistakes. I thought you would not come to see you in my life, and I won’t have any emotions to you. You have nothing to do with me.<br>I picked up the Nokia mobile phone on the ground, and my dad smashed. I thought he smashed my things because let him know that I had this thing. Although I picked it up, I should use it when I brought it. If you smashed me, you damn it. If you still smash it in person, I will definitely remember this hatred. The next time I went to the tuition class and stole other people’s mobile phones, I didn’t care how anxiously others later, and left directly (without her QQ and ZFB, took the SIM card, and it was formatted by it). I secretly use it myself.<br>Parents are convenient for me to go to school. Renting a house next to the school. The tattered house where I live in the sewer is often blocked and the stories come up. Give me a tablet at home, and I want to die slowly, but I still use it. I was still using it when I was doing the question. My mother smashed it. I stuck to hit her. I did n’t know how many times I did n’t know. She did n’t know how many times. I bought the second -hand iPod with the New Year’s money. I have three views. After a long time, I returned and returned, and I changed it for me. Later, my mother also posted me a membrane. As a result, because I played for too long when I played the iPod, I fell directly to the ground. I was hairy at the time, smashing the iPod on the ground. I thought that I hit you last time. This time I broke it and I see you. My heart was dead, especially when I heard my ipod fell into that way, the next day it still rang the alarm clock outside the window. I later bought a mobile phone again. I don’t know why she didn’t smash me this time. Maybe because the mobile phone was too garbage, I could only listen to the Internet. I couldn’t play the game.<br>I may not really fight, but I really will vent my anger and incompetence in various ways. I will collect the pen on the ground and chop them with their feet, and clamp the brands I have made in the class with a cabinet. Occasionally, I can calm down my anger, but I still have a sports student in the class. Once I started to get my temper on the podium again, he came to touch me from behind. I subconsciously kicked his crotch and was caught by him. It was very embarrassing for a while. His acne was more than me (because I was more in high school), and it may be more stressed, so the body was stronger than me and preferred to fight.<br>A classmate likes to play basketball and breaks his left hand with his right hand. At that time, junior high school was about to be finished, thinking that these roll kings would not understand the principle of 1+1 &#x3D; 2. I wrote two handwriting, but I was afraid of rolling you? After I finished my middle school entrance examination, I started to practice my left hand, and even went out to travel on the beach. I was still practicing. When my dad saw my two handwriting, I had to correct it, and threatened to chop it with my left hand. I thought it was just that when he came to see me, I pretended, but I looked at me. I accidentally saw that my parents turned my draft paper when I was sleeping, and I was angry, so every time I made a draft, I wrote the words of cursing my dad on the draft paper. My dad saw my draft paper this time, and he was really surprised again. He was a very “kind” compromise, but he just painted me with a correction band to scold him. I think he is a brain disability. All the rights who have the right to be tampered with history, but this is the Internet. All history is amazingly similar. You cannot tamper with all history. cover up.<br>When I arrived at high school, I did n’t recognize it. I put all the things I learned into practice, but after all, because junior high school was originally the frog at the bottom of the well. Although the high school was open -minded, it was not flying. When I went to high school, I built a class group. I wrote my own abused experience as a psychological drama for my classmates. I bought the college entrance examination questions. It took less than two years to do homework. Office, empty classrooms, and conference rooms are all my self -study room. In fact, the reason is very simple, because this school arranges me to the so -called pointed class, which is the principle of raising the puppets. I can only continuously improve my inner volume method and tap it. The dirty inner roll quagmire. After reporting the tutoring class of the top students at the time of junior high school, I paid a lot of money. In fact, I went to communicate with their frogs at the bottom of the well. I think that the machine will be generated in the future. And two -handed writing forced a science student (female classmate) who likes liberal arts to learn the text. This female classmate I also wrote you a brief introduction and practice method for you to write your hands, and ask you to vote for your school journal. My vision is not high, and the thought is like that. You do n’t include me.<br>My junior high school friends may be more kind (?), Friends in high school (?), One of them, I remember he didn’t want me to go to his house, I had to follow the past. He had a brake, and I couldn’t stop hitting the fence all the way to the fence. I thought you died, and you will die. I followed the past to observe you and improve myself, but now you have become one of the goals of my assassination. I followed the past to camouflage and detective. When the house was selling at home, I sent him my computer (desktop machine, pushed it over with a cart), but immediately took it back, afraid that this fool would throw me or peeking me. (Actually, it’s me Back up the information).<br>I took contraceptives and wearing women’s clothing in high school, because I felt that this can become better. I have no room for improvement. I also wear women’s clothing (improvement code efficiency?), See if this is useful. My mother monitored me all -weather at that time. I wore women’s clothes and wrote a question. She directly pointed the camera to my dad, and asked me to hold my phone to listen to him and scold me. I was frightened that night. I actually told my mother, my mother came over to comfort me again? I sat up and leaned on the bed at the time, as if I didn’t die.<br>The results of the college entrance examination came, and the seven aunts and eight aunts called me, saying that I was good at the test, and I hung up when I received the first call. I was in my friend’s house, and my friend and I face to face, and we both across a wall. I may never meet this friend anymore in this life. I actually confessed to him, confessing to a man, and then borrowing money. In exchange for a word, delete friends. This can’t blame him. These things are all experienced by my university, because I have chosen a major that I don’t want to learn (all majors that cannot be padded, forcing me to endorse, and I can’t use a computer to assist all the subjects that must be calculated. To solve or repeat wheels, you must use the subjects of the library I don’t want to use), a bunch of mathematics, do not listen to the class, learn your own things (very messy and miscellaneous, from the beginning of general artificial intelligence I have studied what I have been caught, and I started to calculate after the college entrance examination was completed. The summer vacation of the summer vacation after the college entrance examination was completed. , I can’t wait to understand everything.), The computer was confiscated (in order to prevent peeping, I directly encrypted the disk), and the money was not given, so I became crazy, and it was even worse. Eat), repeatedly browse stock market information, formulas (since then I only believe in quantification), and even use wireless network cards to insert school computers to see stocks. As a result, the school teachers of the school directly replaced the virtual cloud computers with thin clients. Essence The school is really rich and technical. After studying for a year, my dad told me to learn JVAV. I wrote code (Python and Shell) in my class, and had nothing to do with the teacher’s class. My dad told me to take notes on the book. I said that the use of not taking notes was knocked on, and he immediately came to pinch my neck (really sick). However, next semester, I still go to study the loopholes of these virtual machines. I really researched it for me. I do n’t know how to install Termux on the Android thin client to get Sudo permissions. It was a step away, but I chose to go bad.<br>Seeing that I was still twenty or thirty points of the door courses (go to the machine to choose a conscious answer sheet, submit the papers for 3 minutes), and I don’t give me money at home. I found freelancer.com online to develop plug -ins for foreign gangs, and the target compensation was lower than that of Indians. This broken plug -in requirement has changed several times, and finally made a AI voice recognition and GUI interface. I also added QE’s hidden API, dragged for a long time, and asked me to install it remotely for him. Cross -platform remote compilation to Mac OS (?), After a long time to pay for PayPal, is it like 40 knives? (Each withdrawal of the thief is high). This group of people is an American boss, a Russian editor, playing in the scene, and told me to realize strange functions every day, repair strange BUGs that have nothing to do with me, but do not give money. Although I registered Payoneer, I felt that the foreign rolls were going to die. I returned to a bunch of part -time QQ groups that I had added in China to find a list to avoid starving.<br>I have a bed in my university, and I do n’t even have a table. Using someone else ’s table will be disliked. I look at the headset of the head. I found a job for the summer vacation to take a takeaway (almost on the road of death) to earn enough money to buy this thing. I needed to rest at noon. At the beginning, I went home for dinner and went to bed. Later, I went straight to a cheap food and ran to sleep flat or the corridor. After the summer vacation, I pretended to say that I was going to assault for tuition (fart). I lay on the bed to watch the video when I bought it. I didn’t listen to the class at all. I did n’t pay any money at home. My mother called and yelled, so I started picking up the order directly, earning more than 4,000, and eating too much.<br>At that time, I had concluded how to take a high score. It was nothing more than cutting the book with the book, scanning, and searching for the full text (as long as it was used in the exam), taking a passage is not a dream. I don’t look at these town as a questioner. I summarized the method of establishing the question bank of the small ape search question, but I couldn’t use it. Whoever you want to take the score, buy a calculator with memory search and scan the inside. I am too lazy to have more important learning tasks, I don’t need to lie to myself, I just need to lie to others.<br>Now that I continue to put bad, learn any of my self -media content, I have noted hundreds of articles. However, pretending to be a camouflage in English, because these people only look at a diploma, although they know that the employment of English majors is not dazzling, they still open their eyes and close their eyes. I really prepared the exam, and I really took the transfer of professional exams. It doesn’t matter if you can’t turn it, I think I have to think about what I do after myself. My mother knows that I am learning Python (your news can’t control me, because I am isolated from the world, unless I told you), but fortunately there is a Python secondary exam, otherwise I can’t mix it now. My mother was still trying to ask me to take a computer -level test. I think she can only be regarded as less than equal.<br>My mother doesn’t like me, she won’t let me live in a house, let me live with my dad. My dad accused me every day when we met, said I was spitting badly, said I couldn’t get up and had to go out for a run at 7 o’clock every day, said my grades xjb exams xjb studies, and wanted the door to be open to see me listening to the class (with his back to him) Can’t see anything, usually writing my own code or watching a video). In the beginning, I was relatively obscure, going out early in the morning to stand and look at my phone, and from time to time I would go back to bed to sleep. Since I delivered takeout, I went straight to the top floor to lie down. When I got tired, I went straight to the kitchen (if it was dirty, I dragged it twice), or I lay down and went to sleep. There was a time when he was not at home for no apparent reason, and he walked around the neighborhood with a knife and wanted to kill my dad, which was probably similar to when my brother rushed over with a BB gun and wanted to hit me. On a whim, I recalled the past, and then looked at this broken state now. I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t do what I wanted to do, so my emotions resonated strongly, and I wanted to clear the obstacles in exchange for a moment of tranquility.<br>Women are emotional creatures, with nice voices, love stories (lies), handsome looks, never seen before, refreshing, perfume, and they like it. If you like it, you can give you money, you can have breast augmentation and nose surgery, and you can compare all kinds of vanity. From this point of view, the academic attainments of girls are all created by vanity, comparing for the sake of comparison, and suppressing others for the sake of suppressing others, but they never understand the real meaning of doing this. Maybe that’s the case, involution is the truth, and the world will be a better place if you step on others, at least for you.<br>My mom doesn’t like my dad, except for money. My dad has a bad breath, because he never searches the Internet how to get rid of bad breath, and he eats dinner every day. My dad is ugly because he doesn’t wear makeup like my mom. My dad’s voice is ugly, because he competes with the leader and his subordinates every day, making a big noise, and fooling the idiot over to give him money.<br>My voice is more or less influenced by my dad and it’s also ugly, but I’m learning to act like a spoiled child recently. Ha ha. I also learned pseudo-tones, and I didn’t learn very well, and the pitch reached c4. I still have long hair. Was it to celebrate that my dad was shot to death when he robbed a bank because he owed debts, or was it to celebrate when he got home and was rammed to death by my dad carrying his hair against the wall? I have no idea.<br>When I was young, I was often pulled into social circles as a showy talk or the object of ridicule. In this environment, no one has something in common with me, there is no joy, and I feel that if there is a chance, I must kill everyone. My dad pushes me to say compliments to them every time. As a result, there was a cliché that I had to tell me what the bullshit thought. I directly said that there is a shortage of energy, a shortage of talents, and my IQ can’t keep up with technology. Your future will be finished without artificial intelligence. Everyone was shocked, and my dad stopped asking me to speak after that.<br>My dad asked my mom and I to sign the loan. I called my mom and she said I couldn’t sign for him. When my mother was scolded by my father, I called my uncle because he said he would take care of my mother’s affairs. My computer was confiscated, and when I wanted to encrypt the disk, I called my uncle and told him that my dad wanted to peep at my data. However, my uncle doesn’t get along with me much after all, doesn’t know what I’m thinking, and likes to yell. I’m actually a gentle beast. If you come and follow my hair, I might even give you a piece of meat. Come and pluck my hair, and I’ll eat your flesh. Of course I might die, but I’m well-deserved.<br>Others who communicate with me don’t really care about me, they just tell me their own way of living, and even deceive me to achieve their goals. I never really fell in love with a person because I liked him since I was a child, because when I was with other people (including my parents), I either ignored me intentionally or not and hurt me, or I got angry and hurt others. Moment of tacit understanding, and long-term avoidance, this is my love history.<br>Over time, when I communicated with others, I also learned to be cute(?) and cover up, and often I needed to lie down on the ground or shake my head(?) while chatting to decompress. I even began to learn to repeat others and cater to others, but it was only limited to a short period of time. If you cater for a long time, you must be paid, and the more you cater to, the more satisfied you are, the more money you will get. Let my machine cater to you, okay, call millions of people over, enjoy round-the-clock service without dead ends, and I earn more than 10,000 every day.<br>Stay away from crowds, stay away from society, stay away from the source of evil.<br>Stay away from anyone you want to depend on. Anyone can go bad, not because you like him, he likes you, or whatever, at least for you.<br>Take advantage of others, take advantage of everyone, keep everyone in the dark, and you will win. No one will ever hurt you again, no one who can’t take revenge, no more money to spend.<br>Backup all data to the internet. I don’t live long, but the Internet is longer and greater. The Internet cannot crush all darkness, but it will bring more light.<br>If you are happy, you have to die. I don’t know if this sentence is right or not, but it has been in my mind for a long time. I figured it out on the bus to school, maybe every bus ride.<br>Do people really change? People will not change, and the world will not change, but I am changing, and I am becoming the same as it is. What I turned out to be, I don’t know, but I’ll end up being insignificant and silent.</p>

<p>When you encounter a Redis instance and you quickly want to learn about the setup you just need a few simple commands to peak into the setup. Of course it doesn’t hurt to look at the official full command documentation, but below is a listing just for sysadmins.<br>Accessing Redis<br>CLI</p>
<p>First thing to know is that you can use “telnet” (usually on Redis default port 6379)</p>
<p>telnet localhost 6379</p>
<p>or the Redis CLI client</p>
<p>redis-cli</p>
<p>to connect to Redis. The advantage of redis-cli is that you have a help interface and command line history.<br>CLI Queries</p>
<p>Here is a short list of some basic data extraction commands:<br>Type	Syntax and Explanation<br>Tracing	monitor Watch current live commands. Use with care when on production. Cancel with Ctrl-C.<br>Slow Queries	slowlog get 25 Print top 25 slow queries<br>     slowlog len<br>     slowlog reset<br>Search &#x2F; List All Keys	keys &lt;pattern Use with care when on production!<br>     keys myprefix*<br>     keys *pattern*<br>     keys *mysuffix<br>     keys [a-c]* Use grep like expressions<br>Generic Key Handling	del <key> Delete key<br>     dump <key> Serialize key<br>     exists <key> Check for key<br>     expire <key> <seconds> Set key TTL<br>Working with scalar types	get <key><br>     set <key> <value><br>     setnx <key> <value> Set key value only if key does not exist<br>     Batch commands:<br>     mget <key> <key> …<br>     mset <key> <value> <key> <value><br>Working with counters	incr <key><br>     decr <key><br>Redis Lists	lrange <key> <start> <stop> Accessing lists<br>     lrange mylist 0 -1 Output all elements<br>     lindex mylist 5 Get 5th element<br>     llen mylist Get list length</p>
<pre><code> lpush mylist &quot;value&quot; Push “value” to list
 lpush mylist 5 Push number 5 to list
 rpush mylist &quot;value&quot; Push “value” to beginning (unshift)
  
 lpushx mylist 6 Only push if mylist exists
 rpushx mylist 7
  
 lpop mylist Remove+return value from list
 rpop mylist Remove+return value from start (shift)
  
 lrem mylist 1 &quot;value&quot; Remove ‘value’ count times
 lset mylist 2 6 Set 3rd element to value 6
 ltrim &lt;key&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;stop&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Working with Redis Hashes	hexists myhash field1 Check if hash key exists</p>
<pre><code> hget myhash field1 Get key value
 hdel myhash field2 Delete key
 hset myhash field1 &quot;value&quot; Set key with “value”
 hsetnx myhash field1 &quot;value&quot;
  
 hgetall myhash Get all hash content
 hkeys myhash List all keys
 hlen myhash List number of keys
  
 Batch commands:
 hmget &lt;key&gt; &lt;key&gt; ... Get multiple keys
 hmset &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt; ... Set multiple keys
  
 Counter commands
 hincrby myhash field1 1
 hincrby myhash field1 5
 hincrby myhash field1 -1
  
 hincrbrfloat myhash field2 1.123445
</code></pre>
<p>CLI Scripting</p>
<p>For scripting just pass commands to “redis-cli”. For example:</p>
<p>$ redis-cli INFO | grep connected<br>connected_clients:2<br>connected_slaves:0<br>$</p>
<p>Server Statistics</p>
<p>The statistics command is “INFO” and will give you an output as following.</p>
<p>$ redis-cli INFO<br>redis_version:2.2.12<br>redis_git_sha1:00000000<br>redis_git_dirty:0<br>arch_bits:64<br>multiplexing_api:epoll<br>process_id:8353<br>uptime_in_seconds:2592232<br>uptime_in_days:30<br>lru_clock:809325<br>used_cpu_sys:199.20<br>used_cpu_user:309.26<br>used_cpu_sys_children:12.04<br>used_cpu_user_children:1.47<br>connected_clients:2         # &lt;—- connection count<br>connected_slaves:0<br>client_longest_output_list:0<br>client_biggest_input_buf:0<br>blocked_clients:0<br>used_memory:6596112<br>used_memory_human:6.29M         # &lt;—- memory usage<br>used_memory_rss:17571840<br>mem_fragmentation_ratio:2.66<br>use_tcmalloc:0<br>loading:0<br>aof_enabled:0<br>changes_since_last_save:0<br>bgsave_in_progress:0<br>last_save_time:1371241671<br>bgrewriteaof_in_progress:0<br>total_connections_received:118<br>total_commands_processed:1091<br>expired_keys:441<br>evicted_keys:0<br>keyspace_hits:6<br>keyspace_misses:1070<br>hash_max_zipmap_entries:512<br>hash_max_zipmap_value:64<br>pubsub_channels:0<br>pubsub_patterns:0<br>vm_enabled:0<br>role:master             # &lt;—- master&#x2F;slave in replication setup<br>db0:keys&#x3D;91,expires&#x3D;88</p>
<p>Changing Runtime Configuration</p>
<p>The command</p>
<p>CONFIG GET *</p>
<p>gives you a list of all active configuration variables you can change. The output might look like this:</p>
<p>redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; CONFIG GET *</p>
<ol>
<li>“dir”</li>
<li>“&#x2F;var&#x2F;lib&#x2F;redis”</li>
<li>“dbfilename”</li>
<li>“dump.rdb”</li>
<li>“requirepass”</li>
<li>(nil)</li>
<li>“masterauth”</li>
<li>(nil)</li>
<li>“maxmemory”</li>
<li>“0”</li>
<li>“maxmemory-policy”</li>
<li>“volatile-lru”</li>
<li>“maxmemory-samples”</li>
<li>“3”</li>
<li>“timeout”</li>
<li>“300”</li>
<li>“appendonly”</li>
<li>“no”</li>
<li>“no-appendfsync-on-rewrite”</li>
<li>“no”</li>
<li>“appendfsync”</li>
<li>“everysec”              # &lt;—- how often fsync() is called</li>
<li>“save”</li>
<li>“900 1 300 10 60 10000”     # &lt;—- how often Redis dumps in background</li>
<li>“slave-serve-stale-data”</li>
<li>“yes”</li>
<li>“hash-max-zipmap-entries”</li>
<li>“512”</li>
<li>“hash-max-zipmap-value”</li>
<li>“64”</li>
<li>“list-max-ziplist-entries”</li>
<li>“512”</li>
<li>“list-max-ziplist-value”</li>
<li>“64”</li>
<li>“set-max-intset-entries”</li>
<li>“512”</li>
<li>“slowlog-log-slower-than”</li>
<li>“10000”</li>
<li>“slowlog-max-len”</li>
<li>“64”</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that keys and values are alternating and you can change each key by issuing a “CONFIG SET” command like:</p>
<p>CONFIG SET timeout 900</p>
<p>Such a change will be effective instantly. When changing values consider also updating the redis configuration file.<br>Databases<br>Multiple Databases</p>
<p>Redis has a concept of separated namespaces called “databases”. You can select the database number you want to use with “SELECT”. By default the database with index 0 is used. So issuing</p>
<p>redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; SELECT 1<br>OK<br>redis 127.0.0.1:6379[1]&gt;</p>
<p>switches to the second database. Note how the prompt changed and now has a “[1]” to indicate the database selection. To find out how many databases there are you might want to run redis-cli from the shell:</p>
<p>$ redis-cli INFO | grep ^db<br>db0:keys&#x3D;91,expires&#x3D;88<br>db1:keys&#x3D;1,expires&#x3D;0</p>
<p>Dropping Databases</p>
<p>To drop the currently selected database run</p>
<p>FLUSHDB</p>
<p>to drop all databases at once run</p>
<p>FLUSHALL</p>
<p>Replication<br>Checking for Replication</p>
<p>To see if the instance is a replication slave or master issue</p>
<p>redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; INFO<br>[…]<br>role:master</p>
<p>and watch for the “role” line which shows either “master” or “slave”. Starting with version 2.8 the “INFO” command also gives you per slave replication status looking like this</p>
<p>slave0:ip&#x3D;127.0.0.1,port&#x3D;6380,state&#x3D;online,offset&#x3D;281,lag&#x3D;0</p>
<p>Setting up Replication</p>
<p>If you quickly need to set up replication just issue</p>
<p>SLAVEOF <IP> <port></p>
<p>on a machine that you want to become slave of the given IP. It will immediately get values from the master. Note that this instance will still be writable. If you want it to be read-only change the redis config file (only available in most recent version, e.g. not on Debian). To revert the slave setting run</p>
<p>SLAVEOF NO ONE</p>
<p>Performance Testing<br>Benchmark</p>
<p>Install the Redis tools and run the provided benchmarking tool</p>
<p>redis-benchmark -h <host> [-p <port>]</p>
<p>If you are migrating from&#x2F;to memcached protocol check out how to run the same benchmark for any key value store with memcached protocol.<br>Debugging Latency</p>
<p>First measure system latency on your Redis server with</p>
<p>redis-cli –intrinsic-latency 100</p>
<p>and then sample from your Redis clients with</p>
<p>redis-cli –latency -h <host> -p <port></p>
<p>If you have problems with high latency check if transparent huge pages are disabled. Disable it with</p>
<p>echo never &gt; &#x2F;sys&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;mm&#x2F;transparent_hugepage&#x2F;enabled</p>
<p>Dump Database Backup</p>
<p>As Redis allows RDB database dumps in background, you can issue a dump at any time. Just run:</p>
<p>BGSAVE</p>
<p>When running this command Redis will fork and the new process will dump into the “dbfilename” configured in the Redis configuration without the original process being blocked. Of course the fork itself might cause an interruption. Use “LASTSAVE” to check when the dump file was last updated. For a simple backup solution just backup the dump file. If you need a synchronous save run “SAVE” instead of “BGSAVE”.<br>Listing Connections</p>
<p>Starting with version 2.4 you can list connections with</p>
<p>CLIENT LIST</p>
<p>and you can terminate connections with</p>
<p>CLIENT KILL <IP>:<port></p>
<p>Monitoring Traffic</p>
<p>The propably most useful command compared to memcached where you need to trace network traffic is the “MONITOR” command which will dump incoming commands in real time.</p>
<p>redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; MONITOR<br>OK<br>1371241093.375324 “monitor”<br>1371241109.735725 “keys” “*”<br>1371241152.344504 “set” “testkey” “1”<br>1371241165.169184 “get” “testkey”</p>
<p>additionally use “SLOWLOG” to track the slowest queries in an interval. For example</p>
<p>SLOWLOG RESET</p>
<h1 id="wait-for-some-time"><a href="#wait-for-some-time" class="headerlink" title="wait for some time"></a>wait for some time</h1><p>SLOWLOG GET 25</p>
<p>and get the 25 slowest command during this time.<br>Sharding with proxies</p>
<p>There are two major proxy solutions</p>
<pre><code>Twemproxy (aka nutcracker, by Twitter)
Codis

<pre><code>null is used to represent missing/undefined values.

null is not equal to null. Not knowing two values does not imply that they are the same value. So the expression null = null yields null and not true. To check if an expression is null, use IS NULL.

Arithmetic expressions, comparisons and function calls (except coalesce) will return null if any argument is null.

An attempt to access a missing element in a list or a property that doesn’t exist yields null.

In OPTIONAL MATCH clauses, nulls will be used for missing parts of the pattern.

<p>This calls a subquery with two union parts. The result of the subquery can afterwards be post-processed.<br>CALL procedure</p>
<p>CALL db.labels() YIELD label</p>
<p>This shows a standalone call to the built-in procedure db.labels to list all labels used in the database. Note that required procedure arguments are given explicitly in brackets after the procedure name.</p>
<p>CALL db.labels() YIELD *</p>
<p>Standalone calls may use YIELD * to return all columns.</p>
<p>CALL java.stored.procedureWithArgs</p>
<p>Standalone calls may omit YIELD and also provide arguments implicitly via statement parameters, e.g. a standalone call requiring one argument input may be run by passing the parameter map {input: ‘foo’}.</p>
<p>CALL db.labels() YIELD label<br>RETURN count(label) AS count</p>
<p>Calls the built-in procedure db.labels inside a larger query to count all labels used in the database. Calls inside a larger query always requires passing arguments and naming results explicitly with YIELD.<br>Lists</p>

<p>Properties can be lists of strings, numbers or booleans.</p>
<p>list[$idx] AS value,<br>list[$startIdx..$endIdx] AS slice</p>
<p>List elements can be accessed with idx subscripts in square brackets. Invalid indexes return null. Slices can be retrieved with intervals from start_idx to end_idx, each of which can be omitted or negative. Out of range elements are ignored.</p>
<p>UNWIND $names AS name<br>MATCH (n {name: name})<br>RETURN avg(n.age)</p>
<p>With UNWIND, any list can be transformed back into individual rows. The example matches all names from a list of names.</p>
<p>MATCH (a)<br>RETURN [(a)–&gt;(b) WHERE b.name &#x3D; ‘Bob’ | b.age]</p>
<p>Pattern comprehensions may be used to do a custom projection from a match directly into a list.</p>

<p>DROP INDEX index_name IF EXISTS</p>
<p>Drop the index named index_name if it exists, does nothing if it does not exist.<br>Performance</p>
<pre><code>Use parameters instead of literals when possible. This allows Cypher to re-use your queries instead of having to parse and build new execution plans.

Always set an upper limit for your variable length patterns. It’s possible to have a query go wild and touch all nodes in a graph by mistake.

Return only the data you need. Avoid returning whole nodes and relationships — instead, pick the data you need and return only that.

Use PROFILE / EXPLAIN to analyze the performance of your queries. See Query Tuning for more information on these and other topics, such as planner hints.

(turned out not needed. just some googling for answers)</p>
<p>do you need to export your own good old notes? i mean mi notes. 2 phone numbers, 2 accounts. one with physical storage. the other you may want to download the mi note app and extract in the same way.</p>
<p>Organized under modifier termux ~&#x2F;works&#x2F;bookmark_dirtree_traverse. search via rg.<br>maybe we can organize directory trees using other methods, like some javascript library with both a search tool and a browsing tool. we can host a search engine via javascript, only static resources and client side computation.</p>
<p>this client side search engine usage example can be found at &#x2F;data&#x2F;data&#x2F;com.termux&#x2F;files&#x2F;home&#x2F;storage&#x2F;shared&#x2F;works&#x2F;milkshake_server and .&#x2F;external&#x2F;milkshake_server. the js searching library is called fuse.js.</p>
<p>I have made this into meilisearch, and i have backed it up to github&#x2F;james4ever0&#x2F;notes2 and aliyunpan and baiduyunpan. desktop search experience is better. meilisearch consume too much ram. i consider to find alternatives with less ram consumption.</p>
<p>using rg will be much faster.</p>
